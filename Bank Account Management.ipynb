    "- Encapsulation:\n",
    "The account balance information in the Hesap class is defined as private (__bakiye). Direct access from outside is restricted. However, _get_bakiye() and _set_bakiye() methods are defined to allow access for subclasses.\n",
    "\n",

    "The VadeliHesap class overrides the para_cek() method from the Hesap class, implementing a unique withdrawal process by applying a deduction."
